# ShopVerse - Microservices-Based E-Commerce Platform

**ShopVerse** is a fully modular, cloud-native e-commerce platform built with a real-world production architecture.  
It is designed to showcase DevOps practices in containerization, CI/CD, Kubernetes, monitoring, and cloud infrastructure.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Simulate a full-scale e-commerce system
- Use polyglot microservices (different languages per service)
- Provide a realistic DevOps challenge for CI/CD, K8s, Terraform, observability, and security
- Serve as a portfolio-grade, enterprise-level DevOps project
